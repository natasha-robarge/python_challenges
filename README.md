## Research: What is Python

Here are some general questions you might get asked about Python. Spend some time researching and answering these questions.

##### How does Python compare to other langauges you've used?

Python is pretty object oriented but I can see that in a way, it's easier to learn than JavaScript. I think it's easier to learn because of how the code is made to be specifically more clearer, and it doesn't give you room for errors to slide by you.

##### Is Python a high or low level language?

Python is a high level language. It is a language close to other languages like Java and C which are high level languages because they are machine learning languages.

##### Is it a compiled or interpeted language?

It is a compiled language.

##### What paradigms does Python support?

Functional programming, Object Oriented Programming, and Procedural.

##### Does it have built in memory management? garbage collection?

It uses garbage collection more so rather than a memory management. I mean it could be considered memory management but it really all depends on whether or not you assign a reference to what you want to store.

##### Does it have strong support for functional programming?

Yes.

##### What's the deal with Python 2 vs Python 3?

Python 2 has more libraries and is a legacy. Python 3 also has a different print statement.
